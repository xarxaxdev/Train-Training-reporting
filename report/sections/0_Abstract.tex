\begin{abstract}
This report was created for the course Railway Scheduling at Potsdam University. The focus of this report is creating timetables in an unreliable environment with ASP, which is important for many real-world applications. The environment used is Flatland, which implements many aspects of trains as well as malfunctions. To that end, this paper will detail, how malfunctions work in detail and what different types of encoding were implemented, to generate plans for this environment. This will be followed by a short evaluation, which will illustrate how an incremental encoding is well suited to address the challenges of this environment.
